The Nonfunctional requirement is met in the following ways: First, ingredients are stored as their own objects and meals reference these objects. This prevents duplicates thus making the system more responsive. Finding ingredients is quick because you only have to look inside of a meal and can find references without much computation. This also makes changing ingredient properties easy since you only have to update them once.
