> Functional

For a functional requirement, the implementation of viewing the list of available meals was selected, as this will be the first thing our users interact with when they start using our service.

> Nonfunctional

For a nonfunctional requirement, we will focus on the system being responsive. Since we are just starting the implementation, focusing on quickly accessible data structures now is key to not having to refactor lots of code later.


These requirements relate to each other because viewing a list of meals require that a list be stored somewhere and the nonfunctional requirement makes sure we use the right data structures and methods. They are a reasonable scope since most of the other features require these two things be implemented first anyway, so will will limit our focus to these two.
